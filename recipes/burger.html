    <h1>BBQ Cheddar Pork Burgers</h1>
    <img src="../images/burger.jpg" alt="Cheesy Pork Burger" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These bodacious burgers are positively layered with flavor. Fry-spiced and onion-studded pork burgers are topped
      with melty cheddar and a tangle of BBQ-spiked onion, then tucked into toasty buns. A slick of chipotle aioli holds
      it all together, giving you the perfect, flavor-packed bite. With a heap of crispy oven fries on the side, we hope
      you're prepared for total taste bud takeover.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
      <li>12 oz Yukon Gold Potatoes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tsp Chipotle Powder</li>
      <li>4 tbsp BBQ Sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Fry Seasoning</li>
      <li>10 oz Ground Pork</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Cheddar Cheese</li>
      <li>2 Potato Buns</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Cooking Oil</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce.</li>
          <li>
            Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 2 TBSP. Cut potatoes into
            1/2-inch-thick wedges. Halve buns.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise with chipotle powder to taste (start with a pinch, then taste and add
            more from there if desired). Season with salt and pepper; set aside.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Melt 1 TBSP butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add sliced onion and season with salt. Cook, stirring
            occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 10-15 minutes. TIP: Lower heat and add a splash of water
            if onion begins to brown too quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in half the BBQ sauce (you'll use the rest later); cook until sauce is warmed through, 1-2 minutes
            more.
          </li>
          <li>Turn off heat; transfer to a medium bowl. Wash out pan.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While onion cooks, toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, half the Fry Seasoning
            (you'll use the rest later), salt, and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While potatoes roast, in a large bowl, combine pork, minced onion, remaining Fry Seasoning, salt, and
            pepper.
          </li>
          <li>Form into two patties, each slightly wider than a burger bun.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for onion over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook until browned and
            cooked through, 4-7 minutes per side.
          </li>
          <li>In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top each patty with cheddar; cover pan until cheese melts.</li>
          <li>While patties cook, toast buns until golden.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Spread bottom buns with remaining BBQ sauce. Spread top buns with chipotle aioli. Fill buns with patties and
            caramelized onion.
          </li>
          <li>Divide burgers between plates and serve with potato wedges on the side.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
