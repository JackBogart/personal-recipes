    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A big bowl of pasta never fails to satisfy--it's quick, carby, comforting,
      and my go-to no matter the weather.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Zucchini</li>
      <li>9 oz Italian Chicken Sausage Mix</li>
      <li>14 oz Crushed Tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Sour Cream</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Italian Seasoning</li>
      <li>6 oz Spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Chicken Stock Concentrate</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Heat broiler to high. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
            Wash and dry produce
          </li>
          <li>
            Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise into
            half-moons.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Toss zucchini on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil
            and season with half the Italian Seasoning (you'll use the rest in
            the next step), salt, and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Broil until browned and softened, 5-7 minutes. TIP:Watch carefully
            to avoid burning.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over
            medium-high heat. Add sausage and remaining Italian Seasoning. Cook,
            breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6
            minutes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring
            occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water, then drain and set aside.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While pasta cooks, stir crushed tomatoes, stock concentrate, and 1
            tsp sugar into pan with sausage. Season generously with salt and
            pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced, 5-7 minutes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stir sour cream and 1 tbsp butter into pan with sauce until melted
            and combined. Add drained spaghetti and zucchini; toss to coat. If
            needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water 1 tbsp at a tie until
            pasta is thoroughly coated in sauce. Taste and season with salt and
            pepper.
          </li>
          <li>Divide pasta between bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.</li>
        </ul>
